# shpere

1. Create a new class called "sphere".

2. Create a constructor for that class that allows you to set the radius of the sphere (in any arbitrary unit such as cm).

3. Create a method that allows you to retrieve the diameter of the sphere (which you should be able to calculate given that the radius has been set).

4. Create a method that allows you to retrieve the circumference of the sphere (which you should be able to calculate given that the radius has been set).

5. Create a method that allows you to retrieve the surface area of the sphere (which you should be able to calculate given that the radius has been set).

6. Create a method that allows you to retrieve the volume of the sphere (which you should be able to calculate given that the radius has been set).
